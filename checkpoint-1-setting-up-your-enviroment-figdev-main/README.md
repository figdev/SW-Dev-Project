# Checkpoint 1: Setting up your environment

_Aarrr!_ This is the first checkpoint of the SW Dev Project. It will give you a chance to familiarize with the tools needed in the rest of the project.

To complete this assignment, you will be going through the following steps:

1. In IntelliJ, build and run class **Hello** (under `src/`) and observe the output;
2. Change class **Hello** so that it outputs instead `Hello, Github!`;
3. Make a commit with this change and push it to Github;
4. Go on the repository on Github (from IntelliJ `Git -> Github -> Show on Github`) and check under the **Actions** tab that your code passes the test:
   * If the test passed, _hooray!_ You are all set. You can head to [Gasparilla](http://gasparillapiratefest.com/)!
   * If the test did not pass, _shiver me timbers!_ Something is not right. Fix the problem and try again.
